      <h1>Declaration on Ecological Human Rights in the Digital Age</h1>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>A new form of extraction is emerging, one that reaches into the furthest corners of the biosphere and every nook and cranny inside the human psyche. Capitalism requires an ever-expanding terrain to extract resources from in order to create a surplus. As humans, our relationship with our environment–our ecology–is worth strengthening and protecting. Humans impact the health of ecosystems around the physical world as well as the digital world. As humans we have evolving physical ecology as well as digital ecology. And for a while now, our digital ecology has been eroding the Earth’s ecology.

          <LI><a href='https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22214017/online-shopping-pandemic-packaging-ecommerce-waste-plastic'>Online shopping has become the most popular way to shop due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</a> The packaging is filling landfills and as humans buy new things as perpetually available to them through the digital economy, they also throw old things away that will head to a landfill.
        </UL>
        Ancient cultures in Tibet, Greece, and India referred to earth, air, fire, and water, as the building blocks of everything visible and tangible. These elements, which came to be known as the classical elements, were imbued with cosmological qualities that became archetypes upon which many belief systems were built. Many of these archetypes came to be understood through the elements&rsquo; physical qualities: Fire chemically alters substances it burns. It initiates processes. Water bonds things together and takes the shape of its container. Air does too but in a different way, by expanding like a gas. Earth is solid matter and won&rsquo;t change shape like the two fluid elements.<br><br>
        In this declaration on ecological human rights in the digital age, we adapted the four classical elements to organize four articles of human rights with respect to ecology in the digital age. The elements in this document are used to organize the sections and scaffold the cosmic scope of issues relating to ecology in the task of digitizing human rights.<br><br>

        Earth concerns itself with materiality, solids, and physical byproducts. In the realm of digital infrastructure, data is dirt. In the realm of our global logistics system, earth is the packaging, the planes and trucks that deliver packages, and the carbon they emit.<br><br>
        Air rules communications, intelligence, ideas, social and intangible forces. In the realm of our global logistics systems, air is the actual logistics, the wireless connections linking disparate corners of the globe through supply and demand, the organizational superstructures overseeing international freight shipping and financial markets.<br><br>
        Fire is energy, power, transformation, action, reaction, and processes. In our global logistics system, fire represents energy input and output whether that be fossil fuels or more sustainable sources. Fire is also the agency within each of us to use or not use digital platforms.<br><br>
        Water is life, the way things flow, emotions, and waves. Water in our changing climate relates to declining biodiversity and rising sea levels. In the digital world, water is trends, behavioral patterns, and the flow of data and capital from one party to another. <br><br>

        Technology impacts the world in myriad ways. Technology presents opportunities to innovate, to improve lives, to promote ecological sustainability, and to make the world a better place. But technology also has the potential to exacerbate existing problems as well as create new ones. It can be used to threaten safety, security, privacy, the environment, and even the stability of our democracy.<br><br>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that companies, governments, and individuals alike should all take action and recognize that technology has changed absolutely everything, and we cannot act as if it has not,&mdash;That just as technology has transformed the fabric of everyone&rsquo;s lives, we need to transform our worldview to account for these changes, to recognize and address the harms of the digital age, and to harness the opportunities of the digital age for the better,&mdash;That this new digital technology offers tools to help us, but that we cannot see it as a panacea, because it can also be a poison. We have to recognize the role that technology has played in bringing us to this place in history - the unprecedented levels of wealth and standards of living, but also this state of our planet and its impending climate crisis.<br><br>
        Our first primary concern is for preserving and perpetuating the safety, security, and dignity of all people. We want everyone to have the ability to innovate and to pursue economic endeavors. We want them to be able to live lives that are safe, healthy, and dignified. We want their families and their futures to be filled with safety and stability.<br><br>

        Our second primary concern is for the planet on which those people live. We envision a world in which the climate crisis is taken seriously and is addressed from every angle. We envision a world in which people are doing whatever they can to protect the environment and to ensure the future of our planet. We envision a world in which the digital space is one in which people collaborate towards a better world, rather than one in which corporations and politicized organizations create more opportunities to hurt people and the planet. We recognize that while there is a huge overlap, ever-increasing as the world progresses, a digital participant and a general person of the world aren’t synonymous. A digital participant is someone who interacts directly with some sort of digital system and a person is someone who indirectly interacts or doesn’t interact at all and feels the effect of digital systems. A person also encompasses someone who does not experience any effect of digital systems. This document extends rights to digital participants and people generally where it is deemed logical and necessary not to subtract rights from anyone but to ensure proper rights assured.<br><br>
        We see infrastructure and the digitization of public services to work towards this future. The world will continue to transform digitally whether we like it or not. We would like this to be intentional in a way that seeks to maintain democracy and human rights as well as equity, equality, inclusion, sustainability, security, safety, health, dignity, and the pursuit of happiness. We want this path to be intentional in terms of the rights of people and their opportunities to work together toward a world that is fair, efficient and sustainable. <br>
        <br>
        We envision this document as a central reference point that can be referenced by corporations, politicians, organizations, innovators, technologists, engineers, academics, and others with the potential to make lasting change through creating policy or technology that may impact people. Everyone needs to be thinking about their position at this moment in time and how technology is changing the world around them and how their use of technology changes the world and affects others. We know that as students we do not have direct power over any governments, corporations or organizations, but we create this document with the hope that those with the power to change the trajectory of our planet will use these ideas to promote ecological human rights in the digital world and beyond. <br>
        <br>
        It is our belief that a better world and a healthy, safe, and sustainable planet is possible, and it is our aspiration that we inspire those in power to recognize the climate crisis and resolve to prioritize the protection of all people and the environment in order to protect fundamental human rights. <br>

            <LI>Digital participants have the right to their personal data, metadata, and residual data. Residual data is information that has been deleted from a computer system but still exists and can be recovered and be used in analysis.

This landfill could be Google’s or Amazon or Facebook’s own or it could be the public’s. That being said, with such enormous amounts of data, there will need to be many such locations.

                  <LI>There should be proper digital infrastructure in everyone's relative close proximity that allows reliable and accessible digital connection.

Diversity and inclusion is necessary to the health of digital ecologies, and as a consequence, the conditions of the digital participant.<br><br>
                </OL>
            <LI>Digital participants have a right to an Earth in which technology does not sabotage or betray their right to a clean, healthy, and safe environment. The creation of sustainable digital technologies that do not harm the environment should be prioritized.<br>
                <OL TYPE='A'>
                  <LI>Digital products and services should be made in a way that causes minimal harm to the environment. Digital products are some of the most environmentally taxing services and goods to produce and maintain and dispose of.<br>
                  <LI>Digital products should be designed to last a long time and, so that when they are disposed of, they can be recycled to minimize harm to the environment.<br>
                  <LI>The creation of digital solutions to benefit the environment and promote sustainability should be prioritized. An example of where this isn’t happening in the world right now is how green-grabbing and carbon credits are countereffetive. Carbon finance, a system underpinning crypto finance that’s supposedly woke to climate change is responsible for green-grabbing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/13/conservation">“where land grabs and dispossession of local communities in the South are justified as side-effects of financialised conservation” </a><br>
                  <LI>Carbon credits are also <a href='https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/the-biggest-problem-with-carbon-offsetting-is-that-it-doesnt-really-work/'>flawed</a> in that they don’t limit demand or stop the problem at the source, they simply try to offset it by planting trees. Something important to note is that when a tree is burned, all the carbon it accumulated over its lifetime is released back into the atmosphere. There is no official certification process for the efficacy of carbon offsetting. Companies who want to offset their carbon footprint pay NGOs to take care of it for them and simply use it as a marketing ploy. Many of the trees planted to offset carbon credits are burned for fuel or cut for logging. <br>
